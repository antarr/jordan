## 💡 Implementation Suggestions

### Use Feature Flags

Implement a feature flag system so users can enable/disable features based on their needs:

```ruby
# config/features.rb
Features.define do
    feature :multi_tenancy, default: false
    feature :subscriptions, default: false
    feature :real_time_chat, default: false
    feature :advanced_analytics, default: false
end
```

### Modular Architecture

Structure features as optional modules that can be easily included:

```text
app/
├── modules/
│   ├── organizations/
│   ├── subscriptions/
│   ├── notifications/
│   └── analytics/
```

### Configuration Templates

Provide different configuration templates for different use cases:

```text
templates/
├── ecommerce/
├── social_media/
├── enterprise/
└── saas/
```

Would you like me to start implementing any of these features? I'd recommend beginning with Role-Based Access Control since it's foundational for most applications and would build naturally on your existing authentication system.
